1. The Hidden Shift Problem
The hidden shift problem is an oracle-based problem where the quantum solution shows exponential speedup. We can model some generally used cryptosystems like Poly1305 and CSIDH by the hidden shift problem, and it is also employed to benchmark quantum computers and classical simulators.

2.Super oracle algorithm

In case fourier transform of function $f$ is given this algorithm can be used
